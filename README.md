# cfuen.dev - Cfuen's Portfolio Website

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/07c76189-70f0-4f9e-a72e-038afd5a2327/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/cfuendev/deploys)

My portfolio website, which I'm building step-by-step, slowly rolling out releases to make sure I don't either procrastinate or scrap requirements late in development. I want to make sure it's up somewhere doing something, no matter if it doesn't yet have every planned feature.

### Stuff (Technologies + Resources) I used

- [Astro](https://astro.build/): A static site generator capable of uniting various frameworks in one, doing server-side rendering and so much more. The base holding this project together.

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): The father of atomic CSS, used through an Astro integration.

- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/): A lightweight library for simple JS interactivity that claims to be the modern, simpler and WAY smaller jQuery. Used through an Astro integration.

- [Lit](https://lit.dev/): A framework for building web components, used through an Astro integration.

- [Astroship](https://github.com/surjithctly/astroship): A free website starter template for startups, marketing websites, landing pages & blogs which I built on top of, since it's visual style was very similar to the default style I wanted to achieve. Built with Astro & TailwindCSS. Sponsored by [Web3Templates](https://web3templates.com)
